# Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Python-Project-
A statistical analysis of the Instacart customer dataset comprising more than 34 million rows of data done with Python.
This project involved cleaning, wrangling, merging, and manipulating several million rows of data using Python and pandas.
Jupyter notebook was used to create the scripts.
The datasets used were from "The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017" accessed from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 via Kaggle on 9/23/23
FULL PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
You’re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to
perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria.
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the
same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect
on the sale of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to
ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. The
stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:
KEY QUESTIONS:
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
